REACT: Front-end framework or JS library for building UI.

    --> Components: React component base archtecture, created components can be reused anywhere in the code. their basic structure is: 
    const Component = () => {
        return (
            <div>
            code || HTML ...
            </div>
        ) 
    }

    OBS: Keep in mind to always use Cap letters to avoid errors, if lowercase React thinks the dev is using builtin functions || elements.

    --> Props: It works like atributes to a function is JS. But here they are like atributes to the COMPONENTS.
